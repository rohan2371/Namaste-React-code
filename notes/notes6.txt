there are two ways to export 
1. export default function name  -> it export only one function in file 

let suppose if u want to export multiple functions we use -> exporting by name  
2. export const  fun = () = {};


// default import 
import Header from './components/Header';
// Name import 
import  {Title}  from "./components/Header";
or
import  {Title,Header}  from "./components/Header";


there one more way to import 
let use suppose there are 3-4 functions in single file if u don't want to remember the name what we can import all using the * 

import * as obj from "./components/Header";

we can access those functions by  obj 
<obj.Title/> 
obj.Header 
and many more functions 


there is one more way 
let suppose two functions 
export default Header means exported by default and another one exported by name 

export const Title = () =>{return ()}

how i can import both things in one line so , syntex look like 

import Header, {Title} from './components/header';


// try to use export default is recommended  fo good practice 

Q. What is state 
Q. What is hooks : hook is nothing but a normal javascript  function 

Q. what is useState -> it is used to create a new state 
useState return array -> the first element is state variable and 2nd element is function that changest the state 

const [searchText,setSearchText] = useState("");
in bracket we write default state variable value 

one more way to defind

const searchvar = useState("");
const [searchText,setSearchText] = searchvar;
